# Purpose of the application

This application is the final project for the Full Stack Programming Bootcamp.  It is a MERN stack using MongoDB for data storage, Express for route management, React as the UI framework and NodeJS as the server-side language.

In combination with React, we are also using Material Design-UI, an NPM package that pairs up with React so that development of UI components is accelerated.  Material Design-UI will be used instead of Bootstrap to create a uniform, consistent, and pleasant user experience.
